Exercise 7: Treasure Map Coordinate Filter
Scenario: You have a list of coordinate pairs representing suspected treasure locations on a map:
coords = [[12, 5], [-3, 14], [8, -2], [15, 9], [-5, -6]]. However, the treasure can only exist in the first quadrant of the
map (where both the X coordinate and Y coordinate are strictly greater than zero (i.e., x > 0 and y > 0)).
Write a program that uses a list comprehension to filter the list and print only the valid coordinates.

Hardcoded Input: coords = [[12, 5], [-3, 14], [8, -2], [15, 9], [-5, -6]]
Sample Output: [[12, 5], [15, 9]]
