Exercise 1: Leap Year Checker
Write a program that takes a year as input from the user and checks whether it is a leap year or not.
* **Leap Year Criteria**: A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, except for century years (ending in 00), which must also be divisible by 400.
* **Sample Input**: `2024`
* **Sample Output**: `2024 is a Leap Year.`
