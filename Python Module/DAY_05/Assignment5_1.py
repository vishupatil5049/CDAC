Assignment 1: CDAC Cafeteria Discount Calculator
Scenario
The CDAC Cafeteria needs a modular pricing function to calculate student bills. The cafeteria offers main combo meals, optional side-dishes, standard tax rates, promotional discounts, and delivery charges.

Problem Description
Write a function named calculate_cafeteria_bill(base_price, *items, tax_rate=0.05, discount=0.0, delivery_fee=0.0) that calculates the final bill.

base_price (float): The cost of the main combo meal.
*items (floats): A variable-length positional argument list representing prices of additional side items.
tax_rate (float): The tax percentage (default 0.05 for 5% tax). This must be a keyword-only parameter.
discount (float): A percentage value (e.g., 10.0 represents a 10% discount, default 0.0) applied directly to the subtotal before taxes.
delivery_fee (float): A flat shipping surcharge added to the final total after taxes (default 0.0).
Calculation Rules:

Sum the base_price and all side item prices (*items) to compute the raw subtotal.
Deduct the discount from the raw subtotal to compute the discounted subtotal: 
Discounted Subtotal=Raw Subtotal×(1−discount100)
Compute the tax value by multiplying the discounted subtotal by tax_rate.
Add the tax and delivery_fee to the discounted subtotal to get the final bill.
Return the final total rounded to 2 decimal places.
Example Walkthrough
# 1. Standard meal, no sides, default tax, no discount, no delivery
total1 = calculate_cafeteria_bill(100.0)
# Subtotal = 100.0
# Tax = 100.0 * 0.05 = 5.0
# Return: 105.00

# 2. Meal with sides, custom tax rate, 10% discount, flat delivery fee
total2 = calculate_cafeteria_bill(100.0, 20.0, 30.0, tax_rate=0.08, discount=10.0, delivery_fee=15.0)
# Raw Subtotal = 100.0 + (20.0 + 30.0) = 150.0
# Discounted Subtotal = 150.0 * (1 - 10/100) = 135.0
# Tax = 135.0 * 0.08 = 10.8
# Final Total = 135.0 + 10.8 + 15.0 = 160.8
# Return: 160.80
